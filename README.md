This repository is where the Jekyll theme for w3.org/WAI lives. 

The preview also includes technical documentation.

The components are included in all of the many Jekyll sites that make up the WAI website. Their CSS is also used by tools built outside Jekyll, like the [ATAG Report Tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/atag/report-tool/).
