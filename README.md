# Web Accessibility Initiative's Website Theme

This repository is where the Jekyll theme for [w3.org/WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) lives.

The components are included in all Jekyll sites that make up the WAI website. Their CSS is also used by tools built outside Jekyll, like the [ATAG Report Tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/atag/report-tool/).

## Documentation

The theme is documented at https://wai-website-theme.netlify.app/ along with instructions for creating and editing documents.

## FAQ

### The default branch name has changed. How to update my fork?

Since 4 September 2024, the default branch is named `main`, for consistency with other W3C repositories and [GitHub default branch name](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches#about-the-default-branch).

If you have an existing fork, you can [rename your fork's default branch](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch#renaming-a-branch).

If you have a local clone, you can either delete and re-clone the repository, or update it by [running the commands from GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch#updating-a-local-clone-after-a-branch-name-changes).
