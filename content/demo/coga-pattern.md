<h2>User Need</h2>

<blockquote>
    I always recognize where I am in the architecture of the website.
    </blockquote>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Use a consistent visual design across groups of pages.</p>
<section id="how-it-helps-1"><h2 class="coga-5" id="x4-1-3-3-how-it-helps">How it Helps<a class="self-link" aria-label="ยง" href="#how-it-helps-1"></a></h2>
          <p>
            Those with difficulty understanding how to interact with information
            need to use cues like color, layout and other visual information to
            help them know where to look, what they should do and how they
            should complete that task.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, an older user with age appropriate forgetfulness takes
            a long time to learn new designs. When they come to a site, the
            first page takes time to understand, but then they know what to do
            on the next page. If the next page is different from the first and
            also difficult to learn, they become tired and make more mistakes,
            as they move to a third page the cognitive load becomes too much and
            they cannot complete the task. This pattern helps by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ensuring a consistent user experience by providing familiarity and
              building confidence;
            </li>
            <li>Making it possible to easily use and interact with content; </li>
            <li>Aiding the completion of tasks; and </li>
			<li>Reducing cognitive overload which can lead to increased stress and mental fatigue.</li>
          </ul>
          </section>
<section id="more-details-1"><h2 class="coga-5" id="x4-1-3-4-more-details">More Details<a class="self-link" aria-label="ยง" href="#more-details-1"></a></h2>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Design themes, including heading styles, font choices, symbols,
    colors, visual appearance of controls, buttons and links should be
    consistent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Headings with the same structural level have the same font and
    visual style.
  </li>
  <li>
    Icons, controls and menu items that have same function and role
    have the same look and style
  </li>
  <li>
    State and focus for elements with similar function and roles have
    the same style used consistently across a site.
  </li>
  <li>
    Layout should be consistent, including position of interactive
    elements and navigational controls.
  </li>
  <li>
    Structure of content and style of presenting information should be
    consistent throughout, such as organization of block text, images
    and bullet points.
  </li>
</ul>
</section>
  <section id="getting-started-0"><h2 class="coga-5" id="x4-1-3-5-getting-started">Getting Started<a class="self-link" aria-label="ยง" href="#getting-started-0"></a></h2>
  <p>
    Plan the design for your information before adding content. Think
    about the colors, font choices and areas where text and images will
    appear.
  </p>

  <section id="examples-0"><h2 class="coga-5" id="x4-1-3-6-examples">Examples<a class="self-link" aria-label="ยง" href="#examples-0"></a></h2>
  <p><strong>Use</strong>: </p>
  <p>
    A web page has two submit buttons, both should visually look and
    function the same way.
  </p>

  <p>All selected radio buttons on the site look the same.</p>
  <p>
    When all links on a page have keyboard focus the focus indicator
    looks the same.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Avoid</strong>: </p>
  <p>
    3 pages have a submit button, but each one is located in a different
    place on the page.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are 6 heading level 2s on a page. 4 are styled using Times New
    Roman, and 2 use Helvetica.
  </p>
