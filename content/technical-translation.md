# Translation instructions are after the "#" character in this first section. They are comments that do not show up in the web page. You do not need to translate the instructions after "#".
# In this first section, do not translate the words before a colon. For example, do not translate "title:". Do translate the text after "title:".

title: My Example Document
nav_title: "Standards/Guidelines"
lang: en   # Change "en" to the translated-language shortcode
last_updated: 2020-11-11   # Put the date of this translation YYYY-MM-DD (with month in the middle)

# translators: # remove from the beginning of this line and the lines below: "# " (the hash sign and the space)
# - name: "Translator Name Here" # Add one -name: line for every translator
# - name: "Jan Doe"   # Replace Jan Doe with translator name
# - name: "Jan Doe"   # Replace Jan Doe with name, or delete this line if not multiple translators

### Frontmatter checklist

- All required frontmatter lines for translation interoperability are present. See [Frontmatter guide](/writing/frontmatter/) (lines marked with üåê)
- Add comments
- Adapt footer translation notes depending on content
- Add link to repository translations notes when existing.

## Main content

### Links checklist

- When links go to WAI website, make sure permalink is used and not full URI. See [link markdown explanation in the template](https://github.com/w3c/wai-resource-template/blob/master/content/index.md#heading-level-2)
- When the linked text is the exact same as the title of the page on the WAI website, make sure it uses double brackets. See [link markdown explanation in the template](https://github.com/w3c/wai-resource-template/blob/master/content/index.md#heading-level-2)
