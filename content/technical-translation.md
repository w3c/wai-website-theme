# Translation instructions are after the "#" character in this first section. They are comments that do not show up in the web page. You do not need to translate the instructions after "#".
# In this first section, do not translate the words before a colon. For example, do not translate "title:". Do translate the text after "title:".

### Frontmatter checklist

- All required frontmatter lines for translation interoperability are present. See [Frontmatter guide](/writing/frontmatter/) (lines marked with üåê)
- Add translation instructions comments when missing
- Adapt footer translation instructions depending on content (changelog, acknowledgements, etc.)
- Add a link to the repository `Readme` file when it contains resource-specific Translations Notes.

### Main content

#### Links checklist

- When links go to WAI website, make sure permalink is used and not full URI. See [link markdown explanation in the template](https://github.com/w3c/wai-resource-template/blob/master/content/index.md#heading-level-2)
- When the linked text is the exact same as the title of the page on the WAI website, make sure it uses double brackets. See [link markdown explanation in the template](https://github.com/w3c/wai-resource-template/blob/master/content/index.md#heading-level-2)

## Update Translations Priorities

Priorities for Translating WAI Resources are listed in the [Step-by-Step Guide to Translating WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/translating/step-by-step/#priorities) and in Translations Sitemaps.

To update the priorities list:
1. Navigate to the [wai-website-data {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website-data) repository.
2. Update the `translations-priorities.yml` file as follows:
- `url`: [`ref` value](/writing/frontmatter/#ref) of the resource.
- Arrange lines in the order you want them to appear in the priorities list.
- If you want resource subpages to be displayed, use `pages:` and list subpages `url`s below.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" %}
{:/}
```yaml
- url: "/videos/standards-and-benefits/"
- url: "/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/"
- url: "/tips/"
  pages:
    - url: "/tips/writing/"
    - url: "/tips/designing/"
    - url: "/tips/developing/"
```
{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

## Add Translations Sitemaps

New Translations Sitemaps can easily be created.

To add a new translation sitemap:
1. Navigate to the [wai-about-wai {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/w3c/wai-about-wai) repository.
2. In the `_about/translating/sitemaps/` folder, duplicate an existing sitemap.
3. Name the new file as follows: `sitemap-<language subtag>.md`
4. Update the following frontmatter parameters:
   - `title`\
   Update language name. Example: "Spanish Translations Progress"
   - `nav_title`\
   Update language name. Example: "Spanish"
   - `github` > `path`\
   Update filename. Example: `_about/sitemaps/sitemap-es.md`
   - `permalink`\
   Update with language subtag. Example: `/about/translating/sitemaps/sitemap-es/`
   - `ref`\
   Update with language subtag. Example: `/about/translating/sitemaps/sitemap-es/`
   - `tlang`\
   Update with language subtag.
   - **Note: Do not update `lang` parameter (the language used in the page is English).**
5. Add this new page in `navigation.yml`, in [wai-website-data {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website-data) repository.
6. When published, [Translations Sitemaps list](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/translating/sitemaps/) will automatically be updated.

## Manually Add Translations in "All WAI Translations page"

Some stand-alone resources are not automatically listed in [All WAI Translations page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/translations/).

To manually add resources translations:
1. Navigate to the [wai-website {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website) repository.
2. In `translations.md` frontmatter, update `other_resources` metadata as follows:

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Note" %}
{:/}

In the following list, parameters with ‚ùó emoji are required.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

- `lang` ‚ùó\
  Language subtag.

- `title` ‚ùó\
  Translated resource title.

- `en_title` ‚ùó\
  Original resource title.

- `url` ‚ùó\
  Absolute link to the resource.

  Every translator is specified by their name in a separate line. In addition, organization name can be added (note: see [names and links policy](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/translating/#links))

- `contributors` \
  Every contributor is specified by their name in a separate line. In addition, organization name can be added (note: see [names and links policy](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/translating/#links))
